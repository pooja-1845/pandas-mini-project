# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis using Pandas

This is a mini project for my B.Tech Python assignment. It uses **Pandas**, an advanced Python library, to analyze student marks data.

---

## 📂 Files Included

- `project.py` → Python code for the project  
- `students.csv` → Input data file  
- `final_result.csv` → Output data file (generated after running the code)  

---

## 🔧 What This Project Does

- Reads student marks from a CSV file  
- Handles missing values by replacing them with subject averages  
- Calculates average marks per student  
- Sorts students based on average score  
- Saves the final result in a new CSV file  

---

## 📌 Python Concepts Used

- `pandas.read_csv()` – to read CSV  
- `df.fillna()` – to handle missing values  
- `df.mean()` – to calculate averages  
- `df.sort_values()` – to sort data  

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install Pandas using: pip install pandas
2. Run the Python file: python project.py
3. Check terminal output and the `final_result.csv` file.
